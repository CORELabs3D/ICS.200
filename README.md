## :bulb:ICS.200 3D Printer

ICS.200 is a fully enclosed CoreXY 3D printer designed using The Ice Cream Factory's innovative Ice Cream Sandwich build technique. This printer is built around MGN9H rails with a length of 220mm, offering a generous build area of approximately 165x165x165mm. One of the standout features of the ICS.200 is its scalability, allowing users to easily adjust the size according to their specific needs.

## Ice Cream Sandwich Build Technique

The core construction of Ice Cream Sandwiches involves laser-cut aluminum panels (typically 2-3mm thick) sandwiching a central 3D-printed plastic core. This design, similar to ACM panels like DiBond, delivers an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. The load is primarily borne by the highly rigid aluminum panels, which are 75 times stiffer than plastic. For added strength in high-load scenarios, aluminum spacers separate the panels. The cost-effective nature of this construction technique makes it feasible to produce panels through PCB houses, utilizing 2mm aluminum PCBs at approximately 20% of the cost of laser cutting.

## Key Features:

- Utilizes 220mm MGN9H rails for X/Y/Z.
- 9mm 2GT belts for X/Y movements and 6mm belts for Z.
- Electronics are primarily located in the back, while AC components are housed in the bottom section.
- Toolhead movement is facilitated by two Nema17 stepper motors, either long shaft variants or normal length with couplings.
- Part cooling is achieved using a CPAP blower (Currently a roborock fan).
- The 6mm cast aluminum bed is raised through 3Z 5:1 belt-reduced drives or direct drive (For smaller printers).
- Features Maxwell kinematic joints for the bed, allowing for expansion while constraining other motions and facilitating automatic bed leveling.
- Bed leveling and mesh probing are carried out with a dedicated probe like Euclid.
- Full enclosure with aluminium panels on all sides ensures a controlled printing environment.
