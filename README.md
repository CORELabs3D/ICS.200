## :bulb: About

ICS.200 is a fully enclosed CoreXY printer using The Ice Cream Factory's Ice Cream Sandwich build technique. The ICS.200 is built around MGN9H rails that are 220mm long with a build area of around 160x160x160mm, the design allows for it to be scaled easily. 

Ice Cream Sandwiches are parts made of laser cut aluminum (typically 2-3mm) sandwiching a central printed plastic core.  This is similar in construction to ACM panels such as DiBond which have an incredible strength to weight ration.  Nearly all load is carried by the much stiffer aluminum panels (75x as stiff as plastic). The plastic core is merely to space the panels apart. Additionally for high load situations aluminum spacers also separate the plates. It should be possible to have the panels made by PCB houses using 2mm aluminum PCBs for about 20% the cost of laser cutting, making the construction technique quite inexpensive.

It utilises 220mm MGN9H rails all around and 9mm 2GT belts for X/Y.
Electronics are mostly placed in the back, and AC parts are placed in the bottom.
Toolhead movement is provided by two Nema17 stepper motors, either long shaft versions or normal length with couplings.
 
Part cooling is done via CPAP.

The bed is 6mm cast aluminum lifted via 6mm 2GT belts by three 5:1 belt reduced drives or direct drive. It features proper Maxwell kinematic joints to allow for bed expansion while constraining other motion and to allow automatic bed leveling. Bed levelling and mesh probing is done with a probe.

ICS.200 is fully enclosed with panels on all sides.

The project is being discussed on the CroXY Discord server: https://discord.gg/SeYrseguuf

The sister printer Quattro Gelato is found here: https://github.com/CroXY3D/Quattro-Gelato

A prototype was built based on PCB plates, however it is now being redone with updates and changes (Check Discord for latest updates):
